# ice-cave
This is a game where you slide around on ice and try to reach the exit of a cave. If you've played a Pokemon game before you might recognize these puzzles.
The caves are procedurally generated; the rocks and exit are placed randomly, and then an algorithm is used to find a location to place the starting point that maximises the minimum number of steps needed to reach the exit while still being solvable. This means that the cave is always solvable with a usually nontrivial solution.
